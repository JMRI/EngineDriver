<p>This free application can connect to a <a
        href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/withrottle/UserInterface.shtml"
        target="_blank">JMRI WiThrottle</a> server running on a computer,
    or to an <a href="http://www.modelrectifier.com/category-s/332.htm" target="_blank">MRC Prodigy
        WiFi</a>
    , control your locomotives and your entire model railroad.
    Speed, direction, and up to 29 DCC functions are supported for one to three locos or consists.
    You can control layout power, turnouts and routes, and display panels and other JMRI windows
    using the web views.
    You can also create and edit consists (software-defined).</p>

<h3>Prerequisites (for JMRI):</h3>
<p>Verify your Android device can connect to your network via WiFi and obtain an IP address.<br/>Make
    sure you are running one of the latest versions of <a href="http://jmri.org/" target="_blank">JMRI</a>
    (2.8 works, 3.0+ works much better) on your PC, connected to your layout.&nbsp; Start up JMRI
    and verify you can use the included "Throttle" app to control a loco on your layout.</p>
<p>Start the <a
        href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/withrottle/UserInterface.shtml"
        target="_blank">WiThrottle</a> function of JMRI, located in DecoderPro under Tools,
    Throttles.&nbsp; It is also highly recommended that you start the <a
            href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/html/web/index.shtml" target="_blank"
            title="Learn more about JMRI Web Server">JMRI Web Server</a>
    function (Tools, Start JMRI Web Server).&nbsp;
    Both of these should be added to Preferences, Start Up as well.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites (for MRC Wifi):</h3>
<p>MRC WiFi attached. Verify your Android device can connect to your MRCWi-Fi network and obtain an
    IP address.</p>
<h3>Operation:</h3>
<p>On your phone, start the Engine Driver app and wait for your server's address to show up in
    "Discovered Services".&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on the discovered address, or you can enter the address and port of your WiThrottle server
    directly.&nbsp;
    (Using the values shown on the WiThrottle window.)<br/>
    There is also a "demo" server at jmri.mstevetodd.com, port 44444 that you can connect to for
    testing.</p>
<p>On the throttle screen, click on the "Press to Select" loco button for each loco.<br/>On the next
    screen, click on a loco from the roster list,
    or enter the loco address (verify short or long), and press "Acquire". You will be returned to
    the Throttle screen.<br/>
    Repeat using 2nd and 3rd "Press to Select" buttons to acquire a 2nd or 3rd train.<br/>
    Note: press and hold a roster item to see additional details from the roster.</p>
<p>Operate your loco using the slider (or volume control) (or arrow buttons) for speed, and the
    reverse, stop and forward buttons to control direction. <br/>
    To release all locos, just press the Back button and exit the app. This will also stop your
    locos (can be overridden in preferences).
    You can reassign the volume control by clicking on the speed indicator (the small "v" shows
    which has control).</p>
<p>To create a consist "on-the-fly", simply select additional locos for the same throttle. You will
    be prompted for the direction of each new loco relative to the existing consist.
    Direction and speed will be sent for all.
    Release will release all for that throttle.</p>
<p>Press your phone's Menu button to access screens for Turnout, Route and Power control, as well as
    adjust settings and set numerous preferences.</p>
<p>You can also "fling" left or right to jump quickly back and forth between the Throttle, Routes
    and Turnouts pages.</p>
<h3>Configuration:</h3>
<p>Under Preferences, there is an extensive list of options where you can customize the screens
    and actions of EngineDriver to work best with your device, your layout and your personal style.
    These include fast clock display, speed step options, web views, button size, additional
    buttons,
    slider size and behavior, number of throttles to display,
    stop on release, allow/disallow on-the-fly consisting, autoconnect, and many more.
</p>
<p>If you have entered function labels for a roster entry in the server, these labels will be used.
    If not, you can use the Function Defaults menu option to set default labels and function numbers
    to display.&nbsp; Remove buttons by blanking out the labels.&nbsp; </p>
<p>On the JMRI computer side, check your WiThrottle preferences to insure you allow or disallow the
    control features desired.&nbsp;
    If you've defined your turnouts and routes in a panel, make sure to specify "user names" for
    those you'd like to see listed on your throttle.&nbsp;
    You can also "filter" the turnouts shown using the WiThrottle-&gt;Filter Controls option in the
    WiThrottle window.&nbsp;
    Turning on "Use eStop" and "Use fixed port#" are also recommended.</p>
<p>Entering roster entries, and defining routes and turnouts in JMRI will all make your Engine
    Driver throttle more powerful and easier to use (though not required).&nbsp;
    EngineDriver will show additional info if the JMRI Web Server is started (such as roster details
    and icon images).</p>
