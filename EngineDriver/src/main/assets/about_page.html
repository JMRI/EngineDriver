<h3>Prerequisites (for JMRI):</h3>
<p>Verify your Android device can connect to your network via WiFi and obtain an IP address.<br/>Make
    sure you are running one of the latest versions of <a href="http://jmri.org/" target="_blank">JMRI</a>
    (3.0 works, 4.18+ works much better) on your PC, connected to your layout.&nbsp; Start up JMRI
    and verify you can use the included "Throttle" app to control a loco on your layout.</p>
<p>Start the <a
        href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/withrottle/UserInterface.shtml"
        target="_blank">WiThrottle Server</a> function of JMRI, located in DecoderPro under Tools,
    Throttles. It is also highly recommended that you start the <a
            href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/web/index.shtml" target="_blank"
            title="Learn more about JMRI Web Server">JMRI&nbsp;Web&nbsp;Server</a>
    function (Tools, Start JMRI Web Server).&nbsp;
    Both of these should be added to Preferences, Start Up as well.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites (for MRC Wifi):</h3>
<p>Connect the MRC WiFi module, and verify your device can connect to its network and obtain an IP
    address.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites (for Digitrax LnWi):</h3>
<p>Connect the LnWi, and verify your device can connect to its network and obtain an IP address.</p>
<h3>Operation:</h3>
<p>On your phone, start the Engine Driver app and wait for your server's address to show up in
    "Discovered Services".</p>
<p>Click on the discovered address, or you can enter the address and port of your WiThrottle server
    directly. (Using the values shown on the WiThrottle window.)<br/>
    There is an "Auto-Connect to First WiThrottle Server?" preference you can enable if desired.
    There is also a "demo" server at jmri.mstevetodd.com, port 44444 that you can connect to for
    testing.</p>
<p>On the throttle screen, click on the "Select" loco button for each loco.<br/>On the next
    screen, choose method of selection (DCC Address entry, JMRI Roster or Recent Locos. After
    selecting a loco, you will be returned to the Throttle screen.<br/>
    Repeat using additional "Select" buttons to acquire more trains.<br/>
    Note: press and hold a roster item to see additional details from the roster.</p>
<p>Operate your loco using the slider (or volume control) (or optional arrow buttons) for speed,
    and the reverse, stop and forward buttons to control direction. <br/>
    To release all locos, just press the Back button and exit the app. This will also stop your
    locos (can be overridden in preferences).
    You can reassign the volume control by clicking on the speed indicator (the small "v" shows
    which has control).</p>
<p>To create a consist "on-the-fly", simply select additional locos for the same throttle. You will
    be prompted for the direction of each new loco relative to the existing consist.
    Direction and speed will be sent for all.
    Release will release all for that throttle.</p>
<p>Press your phone's Menu button to access screens for Turnout, Route, Power control and Web,
    as well as adjust settings and set numerous preferences.</p>
<p>You can also "fling" left or right to jump quickly back and forth between the Throttle, Routes
    and Turnouts pages.</p>
<h3>ESU MobileControl II operation:</h3>
<p>The Engine Driver app fully supports the
    <a href="http://www.esu.eu/en/products/digital-control/mobile-control-ii/">ESU&nbsp;MobileControl&nbsp;II</a>
    Android throttle.</p>
<p>As well as being able to control speed of the selected throttle with the control knob, it's
    also possible to switch direction via the zero-position end-stop switch.</p>
<p>Up to three trains can be controlled at once - the train being operated by the control knob
    is highlighted by the small "v" in the speed indicator. Switch between operated trains by
    clicking the appropriate speed indicator. It is also possible to assign one of the device side
    buttons to switch to the next operated train - by default, the bottom-right button is assigned
    to this function.</p>
<p>When assigned to control a train, the Green LED is lit. When no trains are assigned, the Green
    LED flashes.</p>
<p>In addition, you can use the Stop button to pause the currently operated train, or to stop
    all controlled trains. A short press of the Stop button (default, less than 1/2 second) pauses
    operation of the currently controlled train. The Red LED will flash quickly to denote this.
    On a second press of the Stop button, the currently operated train will resume at the previous
    set speed. A long press of the Stop button (default, greater than 1/2 second) will stop all
    controlled trains. The Red LED will flash slowly to denote this. On a second press of the Stop
    button, all controlled trains will remain stationary and it will be possible to again control
    the currently selected train.</p>
<p>Whilst in stop mode, the on-screen speed change buttons and bar are disabled for currently
    stopped throttles. Switching between controlled throttles is also disabled.</p>
<p>It is possible to configure the device side buttons to perform various actions. The default
    assignment is as follows:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Top-left</dt>
    <dd>Increase speed</dd>
    <dt>Bottom-left</dt>
    <dd>Decrease speed</dd>
    <dt>Top-right</dt>
    <dd>Toggle direction</dd>
    <dt>Bottom-right</dt>
    <dd>Select next throttle</dd>
</dl>
<p>These assignments can be modified via the ESU MobileControl II Options page in Preferences.</p>
<h3>Configuration:</h3>
<p>Under Preferences, there is an extensive list of options where you can customize the screens
    and actions of EngineDriver to work best with your device, your layout and your personal style.
    These include throttle layouts, fast clock display, speed step options, web views, button size,
    additional buttons, slider size and behavior, number of throttles to display,
    stop on release, allow/disallow on-the-fly consisting, autoconnect, and many more.
</p>
<p>If you have entered function labels for a roster entry in the server, these labels will be used.
    If not, you can use the Function Defaults menu option to set default labels and function numbers
    to display. Remove buttons by blanking out the labels.</p>
<p>On the JMRI computer side, check your WiThrottle preferences to insure you allow or disallow the
    control features desired.
    If you've defined your turnouts and routes in a panel, specify "user names" for
    those you'd like to see listed on your throttle.
    You can also "filter" the turnouts shown using the WiThrottle-&gt;Filter Controls option in the
    WiThrottle window. Enabling "Use eStop" is also recommended.</p>
<p>Entering roster entries, and defining routes and turnouts in JMRI will all make your Engine
    Driver throttle more powerful and easier to use (though not required).
    EngineDriver will show additional info if the JMRI Web Server is started (such as roster details
    and icon images).</p>
